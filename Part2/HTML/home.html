	<h2> A brief overview of the history of encryption</h2>
	<h2> Encryption is needed to ensure that a message can be openly transmitted from A to B, with only authorised personal being able to understand the contents.
	This usually involves a pre-agreed KEY, which is applied to the seemingly unintelligle messeges and then produces an understandavle message</h2>

                The Caesar cypher was thought to have been developed close to 100BC and is an incredibly simple form of encryption.
                The process involves rotating the alphabet by a set number. Caesar was known to prefer a shift of 4. So A would become
                D and B would be E etc. It was one of the first instances of encryption being used to secure messages

                The Enigma machine machine was invented by Arthur Scherbius in 1918, but later on was used by the german military to 
                send encrypted communications. It was famously cracked by a team at Blethcly Park involving Alan Turing and many others.
                This ultimetly led to a huge advantage when fighting Germany in WW2 thanks to the efforts of Alan Turing and Bletchly Park.

                A hashing algorithm is a mathematical summery of an input of any length and then outputs a summary of that input into an output of fxied length.
                This is commonly used with storing passwords in databases. The passwords are hashed and stored so that in the event of a data breach the attchers cannot understand the passwords in their true form. 
                Another element known as a "salt" is added to the hash to make then more complex and difficult to decypher and elimenated the possibility of dublicate hashes if passwords are the same
